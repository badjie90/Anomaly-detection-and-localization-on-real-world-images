### Image Anomaly localization

In this folder, a sophisticated technique is employed for anomaly localization in images, which involves the use of the [global average pooling layer](https://androidkt.com/explain-pooling-layers-max-pooling-average-pooling-global-average-pooling-and-global-max-pooling/). The task at hand is binary classification, whereby images are classified into two distinct categories, namely, good versus bad images or uninfected versus infected images. It is worth noting that this code was developed with the malarial data set in mind; however, its versatility is such that it can be seamlessly applied to any application, irrespective of the underlying dataset. With this approach, it is possible to accurately detect and diagnose anomalies in a variety of image data sets, providing a powerful tool for image analysis in different fields, ranging from medical imaging to security surveillance.
